            <h3>Tips from former students</h3>
            <ul class="course-goals-list">
                <li>The exam is a lot easier than the course material suggests.</li>
                <li>You have five A4-pages for notes on the exam. Use some pages for general formulas, but also use some for full solutions with the questions of previous exams as they often reuse either the problem in full or only tweak it a little.</li>
                <li>Do earlier exams as many of the questions are often the same.</li>
                <li>Use the literature as a supplement rather than reading the whole book as a lot is not necessary for the exam. Still, be sure to read what's relevant for that week's exercises.</li>
                <li>This course is good to get a taste of what you will look further into in other courses, but you will only scratch the surface in this course. Therefore, it can be good to use this opportunity to take note of interesting concepts which will surely be explored further in other physics courses.</li>
                <li>You can easily cram for the exam the week before.</li>
